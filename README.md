# Elite Strongman Promotions

A bespoke website hand-built using HTML, CSS & PHP for a client, submitted as a Work-Based Learning project in my FdSc Applied Computing course at Level 5.

## Getting Started

The code for this website is stored here on GitHub as a way to preserve the project and to be retrospectively accessed as a part of my online portfolio.

Users are welcome to download, view, and re-use the code & styling for their own projects, however I urge users to seek other resources with which to learn these technologies.

## Built With

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) - The Text Editor Used
* [PHP](https://php.net) - Scripting Language Used to process dynamic content
* [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/mac) - Used to optimise image filesize
